{*
 * Load an image from an SDL data source into a software surface.
 *
 * An SDL_Surface is a buffer of pixels in memory accessible by the CPU. Use
 * this if you plan to hand the data to something else or manipulate it
 * further in code.
 *
 * There are no guarantees about what format the new SDL_Surface data will be;
 * in many cases, SDL_image will attempt to supply a surface that exactly
 * matches the provided image, but in others it might have to convert (either
 * because the image is in a format that SDL doesn't directly support or
 * because it's compressed data that could reasonably uncompress to various
 * formats and SDL_image had to pick one). You can inspect an SDL_Surface for
 * its specifics, and use SDL_ConvertSurface to then migrate to any supported
 * format.
 *
 * If the image format supports a transparent pixel, SDL will set the colorkey
 * for the surface. You can enable RLE acceleration on the surface afterwards
 * by calling: SDL_SetSurfaceColorKey(image, SDL_RLEACCEL,
 * image->format->colorkey);
 *
 * If `closeio` is true, `src` will be closed before returning, whether this
 * function succeeds or not. SDL_image reads everything it needs from `src`
 * during this call in any case.
 *
 * Even though this function accepts a file type, SDL_image may still try
 * other decoders that are capable of detecting file type from the contents of
 * the image data, but may rely on the caller-provided type string for formats
 * that it cannot autodetect. If `type` is nil, SDL_image will rely solely on
 * its ability to guess the format.
 *
 * There is a separate function to read files from disk without having to deal
 * with SDL_IOStream: `IMG_Load("filename.jpg")` will call this function and
 * manage those details for you, determining the file type from the filename's
 * extension.
 *
 * There is also IMG_Load_IO(), which is equivalent to this function except
 * that it will rely on SDL_image to determine what type of data it is
 * loading, much like passing a nil for type.
 *
 * If you are using SDL's 2D rendering API, there is an equivalent call to
 * load images directly into an SDL_Texture for use by the GPU without using a
 * software surface: call IMG_LoadTextureTyped_IO() instead.
 *
 * When done with the returned surface, the app should dispose of it with a
 * call to SDL_DestroySurface().
 *
 * \param src an SDL_IOStream that data will be read from.
 * \param closeio true to close/free the SDL_IOStream before returning, false
 *                to leave it open.
