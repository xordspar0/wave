 *
 * SDL surfaces are buffers of pixels in system RAM. These are useful for
 * passing around and manipulating images that are not stored in GPU memory.
 *
 * SDL_Surface makes serious efforts to manage images in various formats, and
 * provides a reasonable toolbox for transforming the data, including copying
 * between surfaces, filling rectangles in the image data, etc.
 *
 * There is also a simple .bmp loader, SDL_LoadBMP(). SDL itself does not
 * provide loaders for various other file formats, but there are several
 * excellent
  external libraries that do, including it's own satellite library,
 * SDL_image:

 * Pixels are arranged in memory in rows, with the top row first. Each row
 * occupies an amount of memory given by the pitch (sometimes known as the row
 * stride in non-SDL APIs).
 *
 * Within each row, pixels are arranged from left to right until the width is
 * reached. Each pixel occupies a number of bits appropriate for its format,
 * with most formats representing each pixel as one or more whole bytes (in
 * some indexed formats, instead multiple pixels are packed into each byte),
 * and a byte order given by the format. After encoding all pixels, any
 * remaining bytes to reach the pitch are used as padding to reach a desired
 * alignment, and have undefined contents.

 * - `SDL_PROP_SURFACE_HDR_HEADROOM_FLOAT`: for HDR10 and floating point
 *   surfaces, this defines the maximum dynamic range used by the content, in
 *   terms of the SDR white point. This defaults to 0.0, which disables tone
 *   mapping.
 * - `SDL_PROP_SURFACE_TONEMAP_OPERATOR_STRING`: the tone mapping operator
 *   used when compressing from a surface with high dynamic range to another
 *   with lower dynamic range. Currently this supports "chrome", which uses
 *   the same tone mapping that Chrome uses for HDR content, the form "*=N",
